# SAFECITY APP üì±

SafeCity App is a mobile application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that allows users to report crimes and other incidents in their area to the local authorities. The app retrieves user location and shows nearest police station and crime hotspots based on the current location. The app also provides visualized statistics and crime insights to the user. It also provides crime prevention tips and a list of emergency contacts that the user can contact in case of an emergency. The reports are stored in a Firebase database and can be accessed by the local authorities. Once a report is made, the user is notified via SMS. A PDF of the reported incidents can also be accessed by the admin.

## üí° Note

A real-world application would require a lot more features and security. This app is not meant to be used in production. Furthermore, the data used in the analysis is fake and is only meant to demonstrate the analysis techniques. The data is not representative of the actual crime rates in Nairobi.

## üîë Permissions Required
The app requires the following permissions to run:

    ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
    INTERNET
    ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
    CALL_PHONE

## üìä Crime Data Analysis

The [safecity-analysis](https://github.com/lynnemunini/safecity-analysis) repository is responsible for analyzing crime reports, with the aim of identifying common patterns and providing insights to help identify high-risk areas and predict the likelihood of crimes happening in specific locations. The analysis is done using a **fake** dataset of crime reports from the city of Nairobi. The data from the analysis is available in the `data.json` file and is accessed using `Retrofit`.

The analysis includes various techniques, such as data visualization and statistical analysis. The aim is to provide actionable insights that can help law enforcement agencies and other organizations to prevent crime and improve public safety.
